# **AI-Powered Project Management System with RAG**

This project is an **AI-Powered Project Management System** utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to streamline the management of complex projects. By combining AI-driven techniques with structured workflows, the system offers enhanced efficiency in task execution, team collaboration, and decision-making processes.

## **Key Features**

- **Task Management with AI Assistance**: The `TaskAgent` generates tasks based on project descriptions and historical data. The `PriorityAgent` analyzes and prioritizes tasks using a data-driven approach.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The system implements RAG, which integrates FAISS for similarity search and language models via `langchain_ollama` and `langchain_groq` to deliver context-aware task suggestions, reports, and recommendations.
- **Team Collaboration and Formation**: The `CollaborationAgent` analyzes team capabilities and project requirements to suggest optimal team configurations and communication strategies.
- **Comprehensive Project Reporting**: The `ReportAgent` generates detailed reports on project progress, including key metrics, risks, and insights, helping project managers make informed decisions.
- **Workflow Orchestration with LangGraph**: The system orchestrates project workflows using a **graph-based approach**, where tasks are represented as nodes in a **stateful graph**. Each node corresponds to a specific step in the project lifecycleâ€”such as task creation, priority assignment, and report generation. This allows for highly adaptable workflows that can dynamically adjust based on project context and changes. LangGraph ensures that the transitions between these steps are logical, structured, and responsive to project updates in real time.

## **Tech Stack**

- **AI & NLP Frameworks**: `LangChain` for embeddings and retrieval tasks, `Langchain_ollama` for embeddings, `Langchain_groq` for AI-based suggestions, and `LangGraph` for managing stateful workflows.
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI, integrated with SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for storing and retrieving embeddings based on similarity search.
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT for secure access.
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy for persistent data storage.
- **Frontend UI**: HTML, Javascript, Tailwind css.
